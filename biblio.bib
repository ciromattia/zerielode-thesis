abstract = {Within the cultural heritage field, proprietary metadata and vocabu- laries are being transformed into public Linked Data. These efforts have mostly been at the level of large-scale aggregators such as Europeana where the origi- nal data is abstracted to a common format and schema. Although this approach ensures a level of consistency and interoperability, the richness of the original data is lost in the process. In this paper, we present a transparent and interactive methodology for ingesting, converting and linking cultural heritage metadata into Linked Data. The methodology is designed to maintain the richness and detail of the original metadata. We introduce the XMLRDF conversion tool and describe how it is integrated in the ClioPatria semantic web toolkit. The methodology and the tools have been validated by converting the Amsterdam Museum metadata to a Linked Data version. In this way, the Amsterdam Museum became the first ‘small’ cultural heritage institution with a node in the Linked Data cloud.},

abstract = {The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is a formal ontology for the documentation of cultural heritage. It has been developed by the ICOM/CIDOC documentation standards group (DSG) over a period of several years. The complete model is quite complex and not easily presented in graphic format. The current document aims to provides an accessible introduction based on the CIDOC International Guidelines for Museum Object Information : The CIDOC Information Categories (CIC). The CRM is presented as a series of sub models each of which maps directly onto one of the information groups defined by the CIC. In each case brief scope notes are included which explain the thinking behind the reference model and which make explicit the position of individual information items. Naturally, we recommend reading the current document in conjunction with the CIC.},
